# Employee Performance Evaluator

The project that is to be implemented during this Internship Program aims to create a platform that would ease the process of performing the employee assessment at ISD or any other company. Assessment at ISD at the moment takes place via Excel form which consists of various evaluation fields. The process is divided in 2 phases, first phase the assessed employee is given the assessment form for him to assess himself, after that the second phase begins. The second phase is performed by another employee (buddy, team lead) with a higher role which will input his values on every evaluation field. After that a final score is computed. 

EPE will ease the assessment process by providing ways to create assessments, view assessments, assess users (following all the phases), view assessments’ scores, view user’s profile etc. Emails will be sent to every party involved in the assessment: assessed user, buddy/team lead, CEO and the HR.
